The field of computer engineering is at the interface between electrical
engineering and computer science and seeks to balance the tension between
application requirements and technology constraints. Digital logic and
computer organization form the heart of computer engineering: digital
logic transforms low-level circuits into hardware blocks dedicated to
processing, storing, and moving digital data; and computer organization
transforms these hardware blocks into programmable computing systems
capable of executing high-level software. This course aims to provide a
comprehensive introduction to the principle and practice of digital logic
and computer organization. The course will demystify how computer
hardware works and at the same time serve as a foundation for more
advanced courses in embedded systems and computer architecture.

The course lectures are structured into four parts. In the first part,
students will learn about combinational digital logic (e.g., digital
circuits, logic gates, Boolean algebra, decoders, muxes, arithmetic
units). In the second part, students will learn about sequential digital
logic (e.g., latches, flip-flops, finite-state machines, counters, shift
registers, memory arrays). In the third part, students will leverage
their understanding of digital logic to explore computer processor
organization (e.g., instruction set architecture, single-cycle
processors, FSM processors, pipelined processors). In the fourth part,
students will focus on computer memory organization (e.g., main memory,
virtual memory, caches).

The course includes hands-on discussion sections and a series of five
laboratory assignments for students to put the principles they have
learned into practice. These laboratory assignments will make extensive
use of the Verilog hardware description language. Students will use
open-source tools to model and simulate hardware using Verilog, before
using commercial tools to synthesize their Verilog designs to
field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) in the lab. Throughout the
semester, students will gradually design, implement, test, and evaluate a
simple calculator, a music player, and a programmable processor capable
of running simple RISC-V assembly programs.
